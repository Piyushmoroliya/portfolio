        <blockquote>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[c] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)[2] was an Indian lawyer,
            anti-colonial <br>
            nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for
            <br>
            India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
            The <br>
            honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa
            in
            1914, is now used throughout the world.[3]

        <blockquote>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple
            in London
            and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start
            a
            successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
            He
            went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
            resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about
            organising
            peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.

        <blockquote>Gandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of
            Porbandar state.[4][5] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh
            State.[6] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary
            education, he proved a capable chief minister.[6]</blockquote>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <blockquote>During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had
            given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's
            permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[6] and was
            from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[7][8][9] Karamchand and Putlibai had four children: a son, Laxmidas
            (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a second son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).[10][11] and a
            third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[12] who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as
            Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of
            Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.[13]</blockquote>

    <h3>
    <blockquote>As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming
        about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[16] The Indian classics, especially the stories
        of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi
        states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted
        Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme
        values is traceable to these epic characters</blockquote>
