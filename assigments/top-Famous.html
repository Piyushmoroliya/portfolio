    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Sir Isaac Newton (/ˈnjuːtən/; 4 January [O.S. 25 December] 1643 <br> – 31
                March [O.S. 20 March] 1727)[a] was an
                English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer,<br> alchemist, theologian, and
                author.[5]
                Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the<br> Enlightenment that followed.[6] His
                book
                Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles<br> of Natural Philosophy), first
                published
                in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established <br>classical mechanics.[7][8]
                Newton
                also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German <br>mathematician Gottfried
                Wilhelm
                Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed <br>calculus years before
                Leibniz.[9][10] He
                contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered<br> the most influential in
                bringing forth modern science</i></b></h2>

                Indian mathematician. Often regarded as one of the greatest<br> mathematicians of all time, though he
                had
                almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made <br>substantial contributions to mathematical
                analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued <br>fractions, including solutions to
                mathematical
                problems then considered unsolvable.</i></b></h2>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/, EYEN-styne;[4] <br> German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn]
                ⓘ;
                14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist <br> who is best known for
                developing
                the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions <br> to quantum mechanics.[1][5]
                His
                mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special <br> relativity, has been called "the
                world's most famous equation".[6] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize <br> in Physics for his services to
                theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law <br> of the photoelectric
                effect.[7]</i></b>
