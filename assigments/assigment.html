    <h1><blockquote> * Childhood :-</blockquote></h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Shahaji, who spent most of his time in wars, was married to Jijabai. Shivaji was born as their son in Shivneri
        Durga near Pune . He acquired Bangalore as a fiefdom and made it his main military base, and lived with his
        second wife Sudhabai. Here, Shahaji ruled like an independent king despite being a fiefdom. He minted his own
        coins. He built a well-furnished house called Gauri Mahal in the fort area. Nandi Hills was already Shahaji's
        summer capital. Shivaji's first son Sambhaji looked after the administration of the Kolar - Doddaballapur
        regions.</p>
    <br>

    <h1><blockquote>* Martial Arts :-</blockquote></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Shivaji, who lived in Bangalore until the age of 12, was given his early education by his elder brother, Anna
        Sambhaji. Later, when Shivaji returned to Shivneri Durga, it was Dadaji Kondadeva who instilled in him
        full-fledged martial arts. Having mastered swordsmanship, horse riding, and the arts of war, Shivaji had
        conquered Torandurg by the age of 17 and had begun to take ambitious steps. Shivaji, who had received life
        values ​​from his mother Jijabai from a young age, was a great devotee of Saint Ramdas.

        Shivaji, who had received a thorough military education from Dadaji Kondadeva, who was in charge of Shahaji
        Jagir, gained experience by roaming the forests. Seeing the bravery of the Maval tribe of the Western Ghats,
        Shivaji gathered them all and started building a strong army. Prominent Maratha leaders also joined hands with
        them. While his father was living in Bangalore, Jagir, the young Shivaji had discovered the ruins of the
        unforgettable great empire of Vijayanagara (which had fallen by that time) located near the same area.</p>

    <h1><blockquote> Marriage :-</blockquote></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Shivaji, who came to Bangalore with his mother Jijabai and Guru Kondadev, got married around 1640-42. At that
        time, Shivaji's first marriage was celebrated with Saibai of the Nimbalkar family in Gauri Mahal, which was
        inside the Bangalore Fort. Shivaji, who came to the important decision of uniting Hindustan, which was shaken by
        the rule of foreigners, first conquered many forts in the Konkan region. He won many battles with his war skills
        and founded the Maratha state in 1674.</p>

            <blockquote>The family of Shivaji Bhosle, the great ruler of Maharashtra , has its roots in Kannada Nadu.
                The political
                alliance between Karnataka and the Marathas began in the first half of the 17th century. In the
                expansion of the
                state, the Mughals and the Adil Shahis of Bijapur signed an agreement (1636) and were eager to gain
                control over
                the southern part of Karnataka and some parts of Tamil Nadu. Due to this, the Sultans of Bijapur kept
                conducting
                expeditions in these regions. In such expeditions, the Maratha chieftains were at the forefront and were
                responsible for most of the victories. Shahaji Bhosle, son of Maloji Bhosle, was one of such brave
                Maratha
                chieftains. Shahaji and Randulla Khan, who were leading the army as per the orders of Vijayapur , faced
                the army
                of Kempegowda of Bangalore in December 1638. After a fierce battle, a truce was signed and Kempegowda
                shifted
                his capital to Magadi . Bangalore Fort fell into the hands of Vijayapur Sultan. Then, Shahaji Bhonsle
                received
                Jahangir of Bangalore from Muhammad Adil Shah. The place where Chhatrapati Shivaji died is Bommasamudra
                in
                Chitradurga.</blockquote>
